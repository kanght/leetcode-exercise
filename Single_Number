Single Number
Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int x=0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i< nums.size(); ++i) {
            x = x ^ nums[i];
        }
        
        return x;
        
    }
};

note: how to use the vector, to access it via the array indices
